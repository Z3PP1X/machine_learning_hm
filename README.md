## Description
# CO2 Emission Data Analysis


This project focuses on analyzing CO2 emission data using machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression and Random Forests, to identify key factors influencing emissions and forecast future trends. The analysis is performed using Python with libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`.

The project aims to provide insights into CO2 emission data, offering a scientific approach to understanding climate-related challenges. By applying Linear Regression and Random Forests, the project evaluates their performance in pattern recognition and prediction tasks within the environmental data domain.

The target audience includes individuals interested in environmental data analysis, machine learning applications, and climate change.
